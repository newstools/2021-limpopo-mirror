The current Miss SA, Shudufhadzo Musida, seems to have paved the way for many other rural girls, especially from Musida’s hometown in Venda, who now aspire to wear the Miss SA crown. Meet Tshifhiwa Ramutumbu (22) from Maniini in Thohoyandou, who also dreams of wearing the Miss SA crown one day. Ramutumbu, who is doing the final year of her BA in Communications at the North-West University in Potchefstroom, is also among the top 30 finalists for the Miss Unity SA. The lucky lady to walk away with this title will be crowned in March this year. “I feel honoured, to be honest. I have never been so gratified,” she said. “Becoming a part of the Miss Unity South Africa 2021 pageant has always been my dream and becoming one of the finalists makes this dream come closer and closer.” Ramutumbu had previously won other pageant titles, such as Miss Beauty in Christ 2017 (2nd princess), Miss Face of Courageous 2017, Miss June 16 of 2017, Miss Venda Beauty and Culture 2017, Miss Thulamela Municipality 2018, Miss Teen Mamelodi 2018 (1st princess) and Miss Phalaphala Fm Royal Heritage 2019 (2nd princess). She said that being in the modelling industry has taught her a lot. "There are so many things you learn; not only about yourself but also about communication skills, leadership, interviews and poise. Pageantry is a doorway for those who want to be on stage, give back and, of course, learn more about themselves,” she said. “I never saw pageantry as a competition. I always looked at it as a learning experience because out of the whole process; you learn so much that it's beyond mind blowing what you can hold.” During her free time, Tshifhiwa loves doing community work. “I am a part of a drop-inn centre called Thandanani, situated in Mamelodi, Pretoria, where we usually cook food every day and distribute it at different sites in Mamelodi with the aim of fighting against the abuse of drugs and alcohol around the area,” she said.
